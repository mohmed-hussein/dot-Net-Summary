# Entity FrameWork (ORM)


## What is EF:
* Object Relational Mapper
* Convert from database to code (database-first Approach)
* Convert from code to database (code-first Approach) `most common`

## EF Schema
1. TPC  (Table Per Calass)
1. TPH  (Table Per Hierarchy)
1. TPCC (Table Per Concrete Class)

## 1. TPC Schema
if we have this classes
```cs
public class Employee{
    public int Id           {get ; set;};
    public string Name      {get; set;};
    public decimal Salary   {get;set;};
}

public class Product{
    public int Id           {get ; set;};
    public string Name      {get; set;};
    public decimal PricePerUnit   {get;set;};
}

public class Project{
    public int Id           {get ; set;};
    public string Name      {get; set;};
}
```
in database we will find table for every single class Employees , Products and Projects

---

#### `how database will be if there are a Hierarchy Class ?`
```cs
public class Employee{
    public int id {get ; set;};
    public string name{get; set;};
}

public class PartTimeEmployee : Employee{
    public int numofHurs{get; set;};
    public decimal HourRate{get; set;};
}

public class FullTimeEmployee : Employee{
    public DateTime startDate {get; set;};
    public decimal Salary {get; set;};
}
```
in this case the weakness of TPC Schema because of i will get theree tables
and the PK of the base class will be FK in the child Classes
there if i add or update or delete i will do it in two classes (less performance)

## 2. TPH Schema
Hierarchy class problem solved in this schema , how?
by merge all atributes in single table and add more colume to detrmind which calss this row in database
but this approach make new problem the number of nulls will increase

## 3. TPCC Schema
